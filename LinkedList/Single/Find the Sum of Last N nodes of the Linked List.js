/*
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer. Initialize both reference and main pointers to head. 
First, move reference pointer to n nodes from head and while traversing accumulate node’s data to some variable, say sum. 

Now move both pointers simultaneously until the reference pointer reaches the end of the list and 
while traversing accumulate all node’s data to sum pointed by the reference pointer and accumulate all node’s data to some variable, 
say, temp, pointed by the main pointer. Now, (sum – temp) is the required sum of the last n nodes.
