The Minimum Possible Page Limit
Reason:
No student can be assigned fewer pages than the largest book.
If pageLimit is smaller than the largest book, it's impossible to allocate that book to any student.
Calculation:
minPageLimit = Math.max(...arr)
Example:
Books: [12, 34, 67, 90]
Largest book: 90
Minimum pageLimit: 90.

The Maximum Possible Page Limit
Reason:
If we assign all books to a single student, they will have to read the sum of all pages.
This represents the worst-case scenario where 1 student reads everything.
Calculation:
maxPageLimit = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
Example:
Books: [12, 34, 67, 90]
Sum: 12 + 34 + 67 + 90 = 203
Maximum pageLimit: 203.

The Role of pageLimit
The pageLimit is the maximum number of pages that a single student is allowed to read.
When distributing books:
We start assigning books to one student, summing up the pages (pageSum).
If adding a book would cause pageSum to exceed pageLimit, we stop assigning books to the current student and move on to the next student.

Why Check if pageSum > pageLimit?
Avoid Overloading a Student:

If pageSum exceeds pageLimit, the current student cannot handle more books.
At this point, we assign the current book to a new student and reset pageSum for the new student.
Respect the pageLimit Constraint:

The entire purpose of the algorithm is to ensure that no student reads more pages than pageLimit. Checking pageSum helps enforce this constraint.

/*

The maximum number of pages(page limit) that a student can be allocated has a monotonic property:


If, at a page limit p, books cannot be allocated to all k students, then we need to reduce the page limit to ensure more students receive books.
If, at a page limit p, we can allocate books to more than k students, then we need to increase the page limit so that fewer students are allocated books.
