/*
Why These Bounds?
low = Math.max(0, k - n2)

We can't take fewer than 0 elements from a.
But: If k is larger than n2, we must take at least k - n2 elements from a (because b doesn't have enough elements to contribute to the first k).
So, low is the maximum of 0 and k - n2.

Example:

If k = 5, n2 = 3, then k - n2 = 2. So, we must take at least 2 elements from a (since b can only provide 3 elements).


high = Math.min(k, n1)

We can't take more than n1 elements from a (as that's all it has).
We can't take more than k elements from a (since we only want the first k elements in total).
So, high is the minimum of k and n1.

Example:

If k = 5, n1 = 3, then high = 3 (can't take more than 3 from a).
