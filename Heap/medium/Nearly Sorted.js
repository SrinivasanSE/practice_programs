/*

ðŸ”§ Problem Reminder:
Every element is at most k positions away from its target position in the sorted array.

That means:

The element that should go at index 0 must be somewhere in the first k+1 elements.

Similarly, for index 1, the right value is within index 1 to 1+k.

So on.

âœ… Why fill the heap with the first k elements?
Weâ€™re actually going to fill it with k+1 as soon as the loop starts â€” but we preload k so that we can:

Keep a moving window of k+1 candidates from which the smallest is always popped.
