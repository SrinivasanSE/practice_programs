Optimal 
The Sweep Line Algorithm is an efficient technique for solving interval-based problems. 
It works by treating each train's arrival and departure times as events on a timeline. 
By processing these events in chronological order, we can track the number of trains at the station at any moment, 
which directly indicates the number of platforms required at that time. 
The maximum number of overlapping trains during this process determines the minimum number of platforms needed.
