/*

The optimal configuration always looks like this:

All smaller towers (on the left) → increased by k

All larger towers (on the right) → decreased by k

because:

Increasing small towers lifts the bottom

Decreasing tall towers lowers the top

Both actions shrink the overall range


The new maximum is either the largest increased value (arr[i] + K) or the smallest decreased value (arr[-1] - K).
The new minimum is either the smallest increased value (arr[0] + K) or the first decreased value (arr[i+1] - K).
